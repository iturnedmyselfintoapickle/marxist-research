## "The Social Basis of the Women's Question" - 1909
  - issue of gender equality is not separate from the "general social question"
  - the subordination of women is due in large part to economic factors; natural qualities are secondary to this
  - "women can become truly free and equal only in a world organized along new social and productive lines"
  - *partial* improvement can be won through reforms
  - liberal feminism seeks equality from the existing system; view stems from bourgeois class position
  - bourgeois and proletarian women have different aims and interests due to class position
  - gender equality can only be achieved with the "fundamental transformation of the contemporaty economic and social structure of society"
  - equal rights in the present moment are a means for advancing working class struggle
  - women and men of the working class are bound by the same economic and social conditions
    - should be said that aspects of the current system "lie with double weight upon women", though the blame rests on the shoulders of the capitalists
  - from this viewpoint, the aspirations of bourgeois women diverge from the needs of her proletarian counterpart
  - equality in the current system means an equal share of inequality for people of the working class
    - however, equality will more directly expose the contradiction between proletarian and bourgeois women
  - true cross-class unity between women cannot exist
  - modes of production have subjugated women throughout history; only upheaval brought the beginnings of change
  - the early bourgeois feminist movement arose from economic changes that forced petty/middle bourgeois women to either seek access seek right to work or go poor
    - resistance from men to bourgeois women getting careers forced them to band together
    - should be said that proletarian women had long been forced into wage labor to subsist in poverty
    - only the recognition of the labor of women workers in the global market allowed bourgeois women to access independence
  - improvements to the conditions of proletarian women was won by the labor movement, not by bourgeois feminism
  - "the aim of bourgeois women is to secure their own welfare in the framework of a society antogonistic to us"
  - real freedom for women can only be achieved by radically changing the form and structure of the "traditional" family
  - women are forced into dependence upon and subservience to men through legal, cultural, and economic modes of coercion
    - this is designed/encouraged by the bourgeoisie in order to preserve the institution of property
  - women (perhaps moreso at the time of this writing) are driven by economic necessity to accept the auspices of the traditional family, which "oppresses women of all classes and all layers of the population"
  - Bourgeois feminism presents individualized solutions to patriarchal society without attacking the economic basis of those societal relations
    - for ex., the question and problems of marriage cannot be addressed if one ignores the element of private property in marriage
  - only through the fundamental transformation of the economic basis of society can said society allow for the destruction of the individualistic, patriarchal family unit
    - only when the dependence of women both capital and the husband are gone can "free love" actually be achieved
  - bourgeois feminists are "naively believing in the possiblity of creating new forms of famikly and new types of marital relations agains the dismal background of comtemporary class society"
  - interesting example of liberal "progressive" thought (for the time) reinforcing patriarchal ideas: some "social thinkers" at the time regarded marriage as only a method of producing children; motherhood being a woman's purpose; Ruth Bray and Ellen Key put a "progressive halo" over the idea of women as baby factories (my words)
  - on a similar note to previous points, it is incorrect to assume the modern family, which is a product of capitalist relations, will continue to exist in its present form, unchanged, in a socialist society
  - "With the transfer of educative functions from the family to society, the last tie holding together the modern isolated family will be loosened... the slowly maturing evolution of relations betwen the sexes is clear evidence that ritual marriage and the compulsive isolated family are doomed to disappear"
  - although the immediate tasks of bourgeois and proletarian feminists coincide somewhat, the "class colouring" of the goals and understandings of the bourgeois feminists ultimately destroys any semblance of true solidarity
  - "Class instinct--whatever the feminists say--always shows itself to be more powerful than the noble enthusiasms of 'above-class' politics"

## "Communism and the Family" - 1920
  - Divorce/separation from (often abusive) partners is many times a luxury of women in good financial situations
  - The old patriarchal family is changing just as it has changed many times over the course of history
  - "kinship family" (matriarchal) -> patriarchal family -> etc.
  - the form and nature of a family changes also from place to place, culture to culture
  - it is the task of socialist and later communist society to determine the nature of the family according to the new material conditions under which it now exists
  - the family structure of the proletariat in capitalist societies is a product of the past
    - as such, the pillars and institutions that held it together have vanished; it is falling apart
  - the expectation of women to become workers (death of the "man as breadwinner" i.e. insufficient wages to raise a family on one income) and mothers/homemakers forces them to expend all their energy trying to fulfill all those tasks
    - this, obviously, an unfair burden on women
    - in addition, when both parents are away from the home, they must by necessity neglect reproductive labor/child-rearing
  - as the circumstances that held the old patriarchal, individual family unit together no longer exist, "the old family structure is now merely a hindrance"
  - capitalism, with industrial production, has removed much of the necessary housework of times past; similarly, the working woman does not have time to produce the products of housework that have now been replaced by manufactured products even if she wants to
  - domestic labor eats all a woman's spare time and energy
  - however, modern domestic labor does not produce anything for the economy
  - these last vestiges of domestic labor can, in a communist society, be replaced by "collective housekeeping", where there exist men and women whose job is to provide these services to society as a whole
    - rich women have already been freed from this labor (i.e. maids, cooks, restaurants, etc.)
  - the realities of capitalist society (low wages, parents at work, etc.) have robbed many proletarian children of their family lives and childhoods
  - the capitalists are invested in the maintenance of the "old family" because it stifle's the worker's revolutionary spirit
    - "The worker is weighed down by his family cares and si boliged to compromise with capital"
  - under communism child-rearing and education can also be achieved collectively
  - "Communist society will take upon itself all the duties involved in the education of the child, but the joys of parenthood will not be taken away from those who are capable of appreciating them."
  - As the old family withers away, new relationships between people will form to replace it appropriate the the material conditions of that society

## "Women, Race, and Class" - 1981

### Racism, Birth Control, and Reproductive Rights
- "Voluntary motherhood" was a demand raised by 19th century feminists
- Though birth control inall forms is in the interest of all women, it has often failed to unite women of different backgrounds
- 1973 - Roe v. Wade was decided
- abortion rights campaigns in the time of the 1970s were mostly white
  - when the question of "why?" was asked, the answer given failed to address the real cause: "the ideological underpinnings of the birth control moevement itself"
  - by ignoring the often racist history of the birth control movement, they failed to understand Black people's suspicion toward birth control
- Black and brown people are and have been historically very familiar with the need for abortion, particularly as the result of miserable social conditions
  - ex. in NY several years prior to RvW, ~80% of deaths caused by illegal abortions involved Black and Puerto Rican women
  - ex. shortly after RvW women of color had ~1/2 of all legal abortions
  - "They were in favor of *abortion rights*, whcih did not mean that the were proponents of abortion"
- In regards to conditions, self-abortions and infanticide were common among Black women in the days of slavery
- By ignoring conditions or presening abortion as a way to solve those conditions in itself, "The campaign often failed to provide a voice for women who wanted the right to legal abortions while deploring the social conditions that prohibited them from bearing more children."
- 1977 - Passage of the Hyde Amendment: federal and many state govts. withdrew funding for abortions
  - sterilization remained free, forcing many Black, brown, Indigenous, and impoverished white women to opt for it
- women have always looked to birth control as a way to control when, how, and how often they had children
- "voluntary motherhood" arose out of the idea that women could refuse their husband's sexual whims
- the struggle for reproductive rights was born out of the struggle for the political equality of women
- because the demand for birth control was associated with the goals of the middle and capitalist classes, working women found it difficult to relate as they were struggling to merely survive
- urbanization (mat. conditions) lowered white birthrates in the 1890s; this was of course interpreted in the most racist way possible
  - "white suicide" (lol)
  - even Teddy Roosevelt got in on it
- this further exposed the gulf between bourgeois feminists and working women
  - in addition to further exposing the association of bc with bourgeois goals, they also began insinuating that poor people had a moral obligation to restrict the size of their families
- suffragist movement capitulated to "the racist posture of Southern women"
- "Race suicide could be prevented by the introduction of birth control among Black people, immigrants and the poor in general. In this way, the prosperous whites of solid Yankee stock could maintain their superior numbers within the population."
- Margaret Sanger - came from a working class background, began a lifelong crusade for birth control (a term she coined), was associted with the Socialist movement
  - looked as though racist and anti-working-class nature of early fem. movement could be overcome
  - joined the Socialist Party in 1912, gained support from the SP, IWW, and the anarchist movement
- alliance between radical labor and the birth control campaign frayed
- Sanger began to adopt "neo-Malthusian" found in some socialist circles, began to doubt capitalism's central role in causing poverty
- Sanger severed her ties with the SP; began to embrace "the prevailing racist ideology" through susceptibility to anti-Black and anti-immigrant propaganda
- the eugenics movement, which served as an ideological cover for monopoly capital, began to influence the birth control movement
- even Sanger found birth control to be about "more children from the fit, less from the unfit"
- American Birth Control League, around 1919, accept Lothrop Staddard (author of "The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy") into it's board of directors
- Guy Irving Birch (director of the American eugenics Society) started appearing in ABCL's journal
- by 1932, 26 states had passed compulsory sterilization laws for "unfit" people
- ABCL and later the Birth Control Federation of America began calling for birth control among Black people with extremely racist overtones
- the birth control movement had now a clear asoociation with racist/eugenicist ideas
  - "...for people of color not the individual right to *birth control*, but rather the racist strategy of *population control*."
- the birth control campaign served as an extension of US imperialist and racist population policy
- the feminists of the 1970s failed to make amends for the racist history of the bc movement; missing an opportunity to reputdiate sterilization abuse, which was on the rise
- summer 1973 - Minnie Lee Relf and Mary Alice Relf (12 and 14) were unwittingly steriized by the order of the Montgomery Community Action Comittee
  - SPLC filed a suit on behalf of the Relf sisters
  - it was discovered that their mother, who was illiterate, was tricked into signign a consent form for their sterilization by a social worker
- it was later discovered that there were many cases of sterilization abuse at birth control clinics funded by the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW)
- it was discovered that, since 1933 in North Carolina, 7,686 sterilizations occurred, 5000 of which were of Black people, to prevent the reproduction of "mentally deficient persons"
- it was also discovered that, under federal programs, between 100k and 200k sterilizations had been funded by the federal government in 1972
  - for reference, the Nazis varried out 250k sterilizations *in total* during their reign over Germany and adjacent territories
- "...by 1976 some 24 percent of all Indian women of childbearing age had been sterilized"
  - Indigenous Americans were also the target of government propaganda on sterilization
- in 1970 a study concluded that 20% of all married Black women were sterilized and about the same percentage of Chicana women as well
  - ~43% of women sterilized through federal funding were Black
- population control policy for Puerto Rican people goes back at least as far as 1939: FDR's Interdepartmental Committee on Puerto Rico
- by the 1970s over 35% of Puerto Rican women of child bearing age were sterilized
- sterilization has been (and will continue to be) used in the US as a means of reducing the population of impoverished and unemployed people generated by capitalism
- the issue of sterilization abuse represents a gulf of understanding and solidarity between the "mainstream" reproductive rights movement, which often concerns itself with the interests of middle-class white women, and women of color
  - while relatively well-to-do white women have been denied their individual rights to be sterilized if they so wished, sterilization has been pushed (and many times forcibly been performed) on Black, brown, and Indigenous women in the US at every turn
- "Yet whatever the inconveniences for white middle-class women, a fundamental reproductive right of racially oppressed and poor women is at stake."
