- "Scarlet Letters: Getting the History of Abortion and Contraception Right" - https://www.americanprogress.org/article/scarlet-letters-getting-the-history-of-abortion-and-contraception-right/
  - in early US and colonial history, abortion was legal until the first time the mother feels the fetus kick (I.E. "quickening")
    - this can happen between 14 and 26 weeks into pregnancy
  - "it was a safe, condoned, and practiced procedure in colonial America and common enough to appear in the legal and medical records of the period"
  - abortion before "quickening" was legal until the 1860s
  - even Puritans bellieved that life began at "quickening", despite being commonly portrayed as being incredibly strict
  - abortion in the colonies was typically induced through herbal abortifacients, as surgical abortions were at the time rare and dangerous
  - "By 1910 abortion—except in cases to save the mother’s life—was a criminal procedure in every state except Kentucky, where the courts declared the procedure to be judicially illegal"
  - In the middle of the 19th century, US physicians fought against homeopaths and midwives, "to assert the authority and legitimacy of male-dominated scientific medicine"
    - part of this fight was attacking legal abortion, because the "irregular" doctors were often the ones who performed this procedure
  - Also relevant was the racist anxiety over the difference in birthrates between the white upperclass and black people, brown people, and immigrants
  - a coalition of doctors backed by the American Medical association, the Catholic church, and elements of the press started to campaign for the criminalization of abortion
  - "According to Carroll Smith-Rosenberg in her book Disorderly Conduct: Visions of Gender in Victorian America, restricting abortion was one way that male physicians could “assert clear authority” over their female patients"
  - Abortion in the US would not again become legal until 1973, when Roe v. Wade declared it as a right until fetal viability
  - "Distribution of and public education about birth control was legal in the United States until 1873, when the infamous Comstock Act was passed."
    - these "Comstock laws" were finally ruled unconstitutional in 1965 (for married women) by the Griswold v Connecticut ruling and in 1972 (for unmarried women) by the Eisenstadt v Baird ruling
